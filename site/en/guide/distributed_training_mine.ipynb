    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` has been designed with these key goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to use and support multiple user segments, including researchers, machine learning engineers, etc.\n",
    "* Provide good performance out of the box.\n",
    "* Easy switching between strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can distribute training using `tf.distribute.Strategy` with a high-level API like Keras `Model.fit`, as well as [custom training loops](keras/writing_a_training_loop_from_scratch.ipynb) (and, in general, any computation using TensorFlow).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow 2.x, you can execute your programs eagerly, or in a graph using [`tf.function`](function.ipynb). `tf.distribute.Strategy` intends to support both these modes of execution, but works best with `tf.function`. Eager mode is only recommended for debugging purposes and not supported for `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`. Although training is the focus of this guide, this API can also be used for distributing evaluation and prediction on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `tf.distribute.Strategy` with very few changes to your code, because the underlying components of TensorFlow have been changed to become strategy-aware. This includes variables, layers, models, optimizers, metrics, summaries, and checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, you will learn about various types of strategies and how you can use them in different situations. To learn how to debug performance issues, check out the [Optimize TensorFlow GPU performance](gpu_performance_analysis.md) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For a deeper understanding of the concepts, watch the deep-dive presentation—[Inside TensorFlow: `tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://youtu.be/jKV53r9-H14). This is especially recommended if you plan to write your own training loop.\n"

    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` intends to cover a number of use cases along different axes. Some of these combinations are currently supported and others will be added in the future. Some of these axes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Synchronous vs asynchronous training:* These are two common ways of distributing training with data parallelism. In sync training, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync, and aggregating gradients at each step. In async training, all workers are independently training over the input data and updating variables asynchronously. Typically sync training is supported via all-reduce and async through parameter server architecture.\n",
    "- *Hardware platform:* You may want to scale your training onto multiple GPUs on one machine, or multiple machines in a network (with 0 or more GPUs each), or on Cloud TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support these use cases, TensorFlow has `MirroredStrategy`, `TPUStrategy`, `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, `ParameterServerStrategy`, `CentralStorageStrategy`, as well as other strategies available. The next section explains which of these are supported in which scenarios in TensorFlow. Here is a quick overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Training API             | `MirroredStrategy` | `TPUStrategy` | `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` | `CentralStorageStrategy` | `ParameterServerStrategy` |\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: [Experimental support](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/versions#what_is_not_covered) means the APIs are not covered by any compatibilities guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: Estimator support is limited. Basic training and evaluation are experimental, and advanced features—such as scaffold—are not implemented. You should be using Keras or custom training loops if a use case is not covered. Estimators are not recommended for new code. Estimators run `v1.Session`-style code which is more difficult to write correctly, and can behave unexpectedly, especially when combined with TF 2 code. Estimators do fall under our [compatibility guarantees](https://tensorflow.org/guide/versions), but will receive no fixes other than security vulnerabilities.

There are many all-reduce algorithms and implementations available, depending on the type of communication available between devices.

Each epoch will then train faster as you add more GPUs. Typically, you would want to increase your batch size as you add more accelerators, so as to make effective use of the extra computing power.

You also used the `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce` API to aggregate the results returned by `tf.distribute.Strategy.run`. `tf.distribute.Strategy.run` returns results from each local replica in the strategy, and there are multiple ways to consume this result. You can `reduce` them to get an aggregated value. You can also do `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_local_results` to get the list of values contained in the result, one per local replica.\n",

    "For multi-worker training, as mentioned before, you need to set up the `'TF_CONFIG'` environment variable for each binary running in your cluster. The `'TF_CONFIG'` environment variable is a JSON string which specifies what tasks constitute a cluster, their addresses and each task's role in the cluster. The [`tensorflow/ecosystem`](https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem) repo provides a Kubernetes template, which sets up `'TF_CONFIG'` for your training tasks.\n",

    "There are two components of `'TF_CONFIG'`: a cluster and a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A cluster provides information about the training cluster, which is a dict consisting of different types of jobs such as workers. In multi-worker training, there is usually one worker that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular worker does. Such worker is referred to as the \"chief\" worker, and it is customary that the worker with index `0` is appointed as the chief worker (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented).\n",
    "- A task on the other hand provides information about the current task. The first component cluster is the same for all workers, and the second component task is different on each worker and specifies the type and index of that worker.\n",
